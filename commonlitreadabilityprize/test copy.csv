She put on her red uniform and pulled her hair through the back of her baseball cap. She picked up her glove and looked in the mirror. “I hope I get a hit today,” she told her reflection."

Mine was “Ahoy!” But that was considered normal when you’re born and raised on a pirate ship.
My father was the first mate on the fearsome sailing ship known as the Salty Dog. He was the trusted friend of the captain; in charge of keeping the sailors in line and keeping the ship in good shape and on course.
My mother was the lookout who climbed high up the mast to the crow’s nest with her spyglass to look out for other ships, for signs of land, or for hints of danger."

The name “Juneteenth” is a blend of “June” and “nineteenth,” marking the day in 1865 when Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston, Texas at the end of the Civil War announcing the final enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation, meaning that enslaved people were now free. This announcement came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which had officially outlawed slavery in the Confederate states. The delayed freedom led to widespread celebrations among the newly freed Black Americans, which have continued annually."

deportees had crossed the Hungarian border and, once in Polish territory, had been taken over 
by the Gestapo1
. The train had stopped. The Jews were ordered to get off and onto waiting 
trucks. The trucks headed toward a forest. There everybody was ordered to get out. They were 
forced to dig huge trenches. When they had finished their work, the men from the Gestapo 
began theirs. Without passion or haste, they shot their prisoners, who were forced to approach 
the trench one by one and offer their necks. Infants were tossed into the air and used as targets 
for the machine guns. This took place in the Galician forest, near Kolomay."

How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
Mine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,
My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes;
But the defendant doth that plea deny,
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
To side this title is impanelled
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
And by their verdict is determined
The clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.
As thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part,
And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart."
