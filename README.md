# Hackathon Project: Building Together

## Team Members
- Aidan
- David
- Danny

## Inspiration
The idea for our project came from a shared passion for technology and a desire to create something impactful. We wanted to tackle a real-world problem uniquely, combining each of our skills. After brainstorming various ideas—ranging from productivity tools to games—we decided on a project that resonated with all of us and aligned with our strengths.

## What We Learned
This hackathon taught us a lot about:
- **Teamwork**: Collaborating closely helped us communicate effectively and leverage each other's strengths.
- **Time Management**: We learned to prioritize essential features, focusing on a working prototype rather than perfection.
- **Technical Skills**: Through this experience, we expanded our knowledge of [specific tools or technologies used], becoming comfortable with new libraries and integration processes.

## Project Development
### Roles
- **Backend & API Integration**: David and Danny
- **Frontend Development**: Aidan
- **UI Design & Documentation**: Aidan

### Tools and Technologies
We used a combination of e.g., JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, etc., aligning our project components with each team member's expertise. Regular check-ins ensured that we stayed aligned and tackled issues as a team.

### Key Features
- **[Feature 1]**: Arcade themed front-end
- **[Feature 2]**: Ability to tell a student's grading level using AI configuration and a ground-up model
- **[Feature 3]**: Fun tutorial and UI design

## Challenges
The project wasn't without its challenges:
- **Debugging Issues**: We faced significant roadblocks, particularly a crash issue that required us to rethink our architecture and troubleshoot with limited time.
- **Time Constraints**: The hackathon's tight schedule meant making tough decisions on which features to include or cut, ensuring that we met our deadline with a functional product.

## Conclusion
Despite the challenges, we came away with a sense of accomplishment and new skills, both technical and collaborative. Working together allowed us to create something meaningful and strengthen our team dynamic, setting us up for future projects.
